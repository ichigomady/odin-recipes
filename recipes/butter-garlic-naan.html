            <p>Butter garlic naan is a traditional Indian flatbread and one of the most popular versions of naan. It's made with flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and yogurt. Once the dough has been baked in a hot tandoor oven, the golden naan is taken out and brushed with butter or ghee, then topped with minced garlic.</p>
            <p>It's recommended to serve butter garlic naan with a variety of Indian dishes such as curries, butter chicken, dal makhani, malai kofta, or shahi paneer.</p>
            <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida)</li>
                    <li>1-1/2 teaspoons Active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt), whisked </li>
                    <li>Salt, as required </li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon Sugar</li>
                    <li>8 cloves Garlic	, ground </li>
                    <li>2 tablespoon Butter (Salted)</li>
                </ul>
            <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, salt, sugar and yeast and stir to combine. </li>
                    <li>Add the curd, butter, garlic paste and mix well. Gradually add the lukewarm water and knead it into a soft pliable dough.</li>
                    <li>Knead for about 8-10 minutes on a flat, lightly floured surface. (Use the hook attachment for kneading, if using a stand mixer)</li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a well oiled bowl and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for 2 hours, till it doubles in size.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into 6-7 equal portions and shape them into a ball</li>
                    <li>Pat or Roll out each ball to a 7-8 inch elongated, tear shape. (Keep the other dough balls covered while your roll out one.) Sprinkle some chopped garlic over the Naan and press well.</li>
                    <li>Turn it over and brush this side with some wate</li>
                    <li>Preheat an iron griddle over medium heat</li>
                    <li>Invert the griddle exposing the garlic side directly to the flame, without directly touching the flame.</li>
                    <li>Move the griddle slowly so that the Naan cooks evenly.</li>
                    <li>In about a minute, the Naan starts browning and you can see a few bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Using a pair of tongs, take off the Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame. Keep moving the naan for even cooking.</li>
                    <li>Mix the coriander and mint with the melted butter. Brush the Garlic Naan with this herbed butter and serve Butter Garlic Naan with Punjabi Sabut Moong Ki Dal and Dry Methi Malai Matar, along with Beetroot Raita for a satisfying meal.</li>
                </ol>
